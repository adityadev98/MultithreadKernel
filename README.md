# Developing a Multithreaded Kernel from Scratch

This is a multitasking operating system and kernel created from scratch. 

Topics covered:

- The boot process and how memory works
- Writing a boot loader in assembly language
- Working with interrupts in real mode
- Reading a sector (512 bytes) from the hard disk
